Problem1 – Kaspichan Numbers
In Kaspichan we have a special way to write numbers. We use the following 256 digits:
0A26aA52bA…234iA1B27aB53bB235iB……………………25Z51aZ77bZ255iVWe write the numbers as sequences of digits. The last digit of the number (the most right one) has a value as shown in the above table. The next digit on the left has a value 256 times bigger than the shown in the above table, the next digit on the left has 256*256 times bigger value than the shown in the table and so on. Your task is to write a program to convert a decimal number into its corresponding representation in Kaspichan.
Input
The input data consists of a single integer number.
The input data will always be valid and in the described format. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data consists of a single text line holding the result and should be printed at the console.
Constraints
* The input number is in the range [0…18446744073709551615] inclusively.
* Allowed work time for your program: 0.1 seconds.Allowed memory: 16 MB.
